# serial_nexus — implementation notes & handoff

**As of:** 2026-07-22 (**phases 0-8 done + validated on a real Tier-3 rig**, then the
**post-1.0 simplification track (plan §9 / design §16) executed in full**).
**Branch:** `implementation` (off `main`).
**Normative docs are now v7:** `docs/15-design-claude-fable-v7.md` (design) and
`docs/16-implementation-plan-claude-fable-v7.md` (plan). v1–v6 docs (03–14) are in
`docs/historical/`. Section references (§) point at the v7 design.

**Post-1.0 simplification track — DONE (design §16 / plan §9).** All seven items
executed as seven commits on `implementation`, each behavior-preserving item
adversarially re-audited before commit. Final state: **102 unit/property tests**,
`all.sh --through 8` = **45/45** (the original 42 + the new unsafe-gate, jq-lint, and
harness self-test), fmt/clippy/`--target x86_64-apple-darwin`/shellcheck all clean.
- **§9.1 boundary-supervisor library** (`214e237`, §16.1). New `serialnexusd::boundary`:
  `park()` (park-don't-teardown), `race3` (concurrent halves — a *flat* 3-arm `select!`),
  `Backoff::{exponential,fixed}`, `BlockingReader` (loss-notify + join-then-transition).
  serial/exec/leg rebased onto it. The 3-lens audit caught a real medium bug — race3 was
  first drafted as nested `race2`, which biases the tie-break when two halves are ready in
  one poll (a spurious respawn on a teardown/crash race) — fixed to a flat select; plus a
  `fixed(0)` floor divergence. 8 boundary tests.
- **§9.2 critical-section cell** (`362a11e`, §16.2). `serialnexusd::cell::CriticalCell`
  (closure-only `with`/`with_mut`) replaces **every** `RefCell` in serialnexusd (daemon
  state, `LockCell`, all node shared cells); `serialnexusd/clippy.toml` bans
  `std::cell::RefCell` via `disallowed-types` (per-crate scoping via `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`,
  confirmed on clippy 0.1.97). The "borrow never crosses `.await`" tripwire is now a
  compile-shape fact. Audit clean. Gate proven (clippy fails on a planted RefCell). 3 tests.
- **§9.3 nexus-sys crate** (`052fb8a`, §16.3). New `nexus-sys` = all unsafe (ioctls,
  ptsname, poll); daemon/doctor `sys.rs` deleted, sim's local unsafe removed; every other
  crate now `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. `scripts/validate/phase0/unsafe-gate.sh` proves
  confinement (detector-proven). doctor `read_icounter`/`SerialIcounter` → canonical
  `read_icounts`/`SerialIcounts`. macOS cross-check clean.
- **§9.4+§9.5 harness + CI hardening** (`7f097e0`, §16.5). `scripts/lib/assert.sh` (tested
  helpers; the loss-counter check with correct `(add // 0) == 0`), `phase0/harness-selftest.sh`
  (feeds a nonzero counter, asserts the helper *fails* — the anti-tautology regression),
  `phase0/jq-lint.sh` (compiles .jq files + greps the `// N ==` antipattern), `.shellcheckrc`
  + **shellcheck green** across scripts/. soak.sh uses the tested helper. CI `harness-lint`
  (per-push) + `sweep-nightly` (full `--through 8`, archives the verdict JSON). `all.sh`
  gained `--json-summary`.
- **§9.6 state-file fsync** (`f129a2f`, §16.6). `atomic_write` fsyncs temp before rename +
  dir after (strace-confirmed `fsync→rename→fsync`); comment-pinned test; crash-recovery
  script stays green.
- **§9.7 error-code registry** (`0756022`, §16.8). `nexus_rpc::AppError` enum = single
  registry; daemon `app_errors` re-exports its `.code()`; `error_code_registry()`; test
  `docs_rpc_table_matches_the_registry` asserts docs/rpc ↔ registry (catches undocumented
  or unregistered codes — the audit's `-32001` bug).

Design §16.9 (full readiness unification) stays **rejected** and §16.10 (standing §14
deferrals) stays **deferred** — deliberately NOT implemented. §16.7 is a checklist doctrine,
not a code task. NOT pushed; no `main` merge.

---
The remainder of this document (below) is the phase 0-8 build history, unchanged.

**Physical validation on a real Tier-3 rig (2026-07-22).** First end-to-end run on
real silicon — two FTDI FT232R adapters (`usb:0403:6001:BH00L4KU:00` /dev/ttyUSB0 ↔
`usb:0403:6001:BH00LL8O:00` /dev/ttyUSB1) cross-wired as a null modem. Device access
is resolved (the dev user is in `dialout`; the old "S3 access pending" caveat no longer
applies). `nexus-doctor` baseline was clean (12/12), and the rig cert surfaced **the
first genuine real-hardware bug** — in the *doctor*, not the daemon: `p5_certify_pair`
(§15.21) had never run against real UARTs (the sim skips it as "not a UART"), and it
reopened both ports per rate and transmitted *before the FTDI applied the new baud
divisor*, so the rate ladder garbled at 115200+ and reported `rate_ladder=false` while
an independent pyserial test proved the physical link flawless 9600..921600. **Fixed
(`nexus-doctor/src/probes.rs`, commit `8cf61d0`):** a 150 ms post-open baud settle
before each single-shot exchange, a **both-direction** ladder (§15.21 "all must
round-trip", closing a pre-existing one-way gap), and a bulkier mismatch pattern so the
frame-error observation is deterministic — verified `rate_ladder=true
deliberate_mismatch_observed=true`, 6/6. Diagnostic-only; no daemon/data-plane change,
sim `phase7/p5.sh` CI path unaffected. The daemon was then driven through the rig and
**every behavior passed**: identity resolution both directions (§12), byte-exact
bidirectional data path (§4/§5/§7.1), the `send` verb, far-side break reception
(port1.brk++), TIOCEXCL exclusivity, exclusive arbitration (lock→LOCKED→steal, §6),
slow-consumer drop-with-counters isolation (§5, exact `received+dropped==sent`), the PTY
symmetric config over the §15.19 writer bridge, and observable framing/parity error
counters under a deliberate baud/parity mismatch. A 4-agent adversarial audit found **no
false passes** and confirmed the doctor fix correct and complete. Codified as
`scripts/validate/hardware/crossover-rig.sh` (commit `906c309`; see the hardware block
under Quality gates). A **guided physical unplug/replug** was then performed live and
passed on every point (§7.1 faulted-and-wait + reopen ritual, §15.25): on unplug the
node reached `waiting` while its attached PTY client stayed present (no HUP) and the
other node stayed `active` (isolation); a command written during the outage parked
(backpressure, never sent); on replug the node auto-healed to `active` by identity,
the reopen ritual reapplied (modem lines reasserted, driver counters fresh, `TIOCEXCL`
retaken), `purged_on_reconnect` equalled the parked command's length exactly (drained,
never fired into the reconnected device), and the healed port carried data both
directions again. Still needs a human hand (inherently interactive, not scripted):
squatter swap (a *different* adapter appearing on the old identity's path) and far-side
modem-line assertion (the 3-wire crossover carries no DTR/RTS to the peer).

**v6 revision + phase 0-4 alignment (2026-07-21).** The v6 docs are v5 with the
phase-5/6 ADRs (§15.22–15.24) *condensed* and their refinements folded forward into
§§3–11 as normative text plus forward-references; the plan gained two doc-only
sentences (endpoint-keyed wiring §15.23; the "presence is not readiness" §4 test note).
The normative additions touching phases 0-4: §6 now states *held-priority reclaim* as
first-class arbitration text (was §15.23-only); §11's structural-atomicity clause now
lists *name/identity legality* ("no `/`, no empties, no duplicate node names or channel
identities"); §3/§5 boundary taxonomy now names *child stdio pipes*. A multi-agent
adversarial audit of the **built** phase 0-4 code against v6 (one auditor per design
area, every finding independently verified) surfaced **5 confirmed deviations** (7
rejected as phase-7/8 scope, sanctioned poll-latency, or code-smell-not-design-text):
- **§11 empty node name accepted** (v6-introduced "no empties"): empty *channel
  identities* were rejected but empty *node names* were not. **Fixed** —
  `ValidationError::EmptyName`, checked in `GraphModel::validate` (covers `load` and
  incremental add-node), with `empty_node_name_is_rejected`.
- **`data.rs` comment said "four boundary types"** (v6 expanded to five, +child stdio
  pipes). **Fixed** — comment now enumerates the five, noting the exec pipe arrives in
  phase 5.
- **Four pre-existing config/CLI-surface gaps** (identical text in v5; the design lists
  a v1 attribute never built — **the user chose to build all now**): (a) serial
  `hostward_buffer` (§7.1 hostward-consumer drop policy → the fan-out channel depth,
  default 256), (b) serial `modem` initial DTR/RTS assertions (§7.1, applied at open,
  retained for phase-7 reopen), (c) PTY `hostward_buffer` (§7.2 → the writer-bridge
  depth, default 32), (d) daemon `--socket-group` (§10 "flags to widen to a group" →
  chgrp + mode 0660). All default to today's behavior, round-trip through dump/load
  (`serial_and_pty_hostward_and_modem_round_trip` + the config proptest), and were
  verified end-to-end (load→dump, `--socket-group` → `660 <group>`). See §3.13.
All gates green: 78 workspace tests, fmt/clippy clean, `all.sh --through 6` = 32/32.

**Phase 6 (2026-07-21).** The cross-daemon transport (§7.4/§9): a new **leg node**
(`nodes/leg.rs`) carrying N channels multiplexed over a tcp|unix socket by the
built-in **link codec** (the shared envelope, §8). `codec-api` grew the **v1 wire
hello** (`WIRE_MAGIC` "SNXL", `WIRE_VERSION` distinct from `ENVELOPE_VERSION`, a `u32`
capability bitset with `CAP_LOCK_RELAY` reserved, `Hello`/`encode_hello`/
`try_decode_hello`, `WireError`) — a distinct wire construct, not a fifth event kind,
so the four golden vectors stay frozen. `nexus-core` gained the `NodeConfig::Leg`
variant (+ `Transport`/`LegRole`), the leg `shape()` (N channel endpoints, no default
endpoint), and config-level validation (loopback-only unless `insecure_bind`, empty
channel/list rejection → new `ValidationError::{NonLoopbackBind,EmptyLeg}`). The leg
plugs into the §15.23 endpoint-keyed `Wiring` with **zero `Wiring::build` change** —
purely via `shape()`. `nexus-sim` grew `wire` (hostile-or-conforming peer / §9
conformance driver) and `tcp-proxy` (outage injection) modes, plus `pty --stall`. One
new ADR landed — **§15.24** (the leg node, the hello frame, fragmentation-not-drop,
faulted-and-wait); §7.5/§15.23/§14 were touched for the re-multiplexer scoping. A
multi-agent adversarial audit of the built phase 6 found **17 confirmed issues, all
fixed** — most importantly a **critical §5/§9 targetward-no-drop violation** (the leg's
write half `continue`d on an oversize-frame encode error, silently dropping any chunk
whose framed size exceeded `MAX_FRAME_SIZE` — reachable because `READ_BUF ==
MAX_FRAME_SIZE` and the `send` verb line is uncapped; **fixed** by fragmenting oversize
chunks across consecutive `data` frames, verified with a 100 001-byte `send`
round-trip) and a **stale-status wedge** (a `faces=target` leg whose local producers
closed returned `SourceClosed` and left status `Active`/"connected" forever; **fixed**
by parking the write half so the independent read direction and the wire stay live).
See §6d below.

**Phase 5 (2026-07-21).** The codec runtime (§7.5/§7.6/§8): a new `codecs/reference`
crate (the v1 envelope framing as a `Codec`, with length-guided resync); the
interior **codec node** (`nodes/codec.rs`) and **exec codec node** (`nodes/exec.rs`)
on a **generalized endpoint-keyed data-plane wiring** (interior nodes have N+1
endpoints — the first non-two-layer topology); `nexus-sim` grew `mux`/`envelope`
modes; two new ADRs landed — **§15.22** (exec child protocol: the multiplexed side
is a reserved empty channel; the exec codec is a child-pipe boundary, not a pure §5
interior node) and **§15.23** (endpoint-keyed wiring, length-guided resync,
held-priority reclaim); §3/§7.5/§7.6 were touched. A multi-agent adversarial audit of
the built phase 5 found **14 confirmed issues, all fixed** — most importantly a
**critical exec-pump deadlock** (the single `select!` coupled stdin-write and
stdout-read; under sustained flow the child filled its stdout pipe and blocked on
stdin while the daemon blocked writing stdin — fixed by running the two directions as
*concurrently-polled* futures) and **held-lock re-acquire** (was FIFO, letting a
non-held `--wait` waiter inherit the mux lock; now a `reclaim_held` primitive with
priority over on-demand waiters). See §6c below.

**v3 revision (2026-07-20).** The v3 docs folded the refinements below (§3.1–3.10)
into the design text and added two new normative requirements that phase 0-2 code
was realigned to satisfy: (a) design §3 now makes a node name or channel identity
containing `/` a **structural validation error** — enforced in
`nexus_core::graph::GraphModel::validate` (`ValidationError::InvalidName`); and
(b) plan §2 now requires **`Cargo.lock` committed** (the cargo-deny gate is only as
strong as the committed graph) — `Cargo.lock` was un-gitignored and checked in. The
lingering `serial2-tokio` workspace-dependency declaration was also dropped (§13,
§15.1), matching the design narrative that it was removed during implementation.

**v4 revision + audit (2026-07-20).** The v4 docs are v3 plus one substantive
change: the phase-3 hybrid data plane (§3.11 below) was folded into design §5 and
recorded as a new ADR **§15.19** ("The benchmark cashed the escape hatch: a hybrid
data plane"), with **§15.18** now carrying a "(Superseded in part by §15.19)" note.
The split is now clean: §15.18 owns only the *poll(2)-not-epoll / `AsyncFd`-
prohibition* decision, while §15.19 owns the *dedicated blocking threads for the
hot hostward paths* (serial reader, PTY master writer) and the *adaptive
active-to-idle backoff* for the cold async paths. Phase 0-3 was then re-audited
against v4 (multi-agent + adversarial verify). Two genuine deviations were found
and fixed: (a) the PTY node re-asserted the baseline termios on last close only
when the close was observed via POLLHUP, skipping it when the read path saw
EOF/EIO first (§7.2) — `nodes/pty.rs` now does a swap-guarded reset on all three
paths, and the reconciliation backstop is gated on live presence; (b)
`scripts/validate/phase3/subscribe.sh` used a bare `sleep 0.3` to await
subscription registration, against plan §3 — now a bounded `wait-for` on the first
snapshot. Code comments that cited §15.18 for the thread/backoff decision were
repointed to §15.19. No other phase 0-3 deviations surfaced.

**v5 revision + phase 0-4 alignment audit (2026-07-20).** The v5 docs are v4 plus
the slice-C/P5 specification: design §6 gained a "Waiting and fairness" paragraph
(the FIFO waiter queue), lease generation-guarding, and the poll-sampled-presence
blind-spot note; §10 gained a "Waiting verbs" paragraph; §13/§14 gained P5 (doctor
rig certification) and the deferred per-open PTY epoch; and two new ADRs landed —
**§15.20** ("Waiting verbs: the two-lane control plane") and **§15.21** ("The rig
is a fixture, so the doctor certifies it"). A multi-agent adversarial audit of the
**built** phase 0-4 code against v5 found **one genuine deviation, fixed**: a
`waiting`/`faulted` serial node (device absent — a reachable startup state) drained
and silently discarded every targetward chunk (`while rx.recv().await.is_some(){}`),
violating §5's never-drop-targetward invariant. `nodes/serial.rs` now **parks the
targetward receiver unread** (field `parked_targetward`), so the bounded channel
fills and backpressures the origin (commands delayed, never dropped); only the
phase-7 reopen/heal is deferred, not the invariant. Everything else in phases 0-3 +
slice A/B verified faithful to v5.

This document records where the implementation stands and every place the code
deviates from — or refines — the design. The rule from plan §1 holds: where
implementation reality disagrees with the design, the design gets amended first;
the items below are refinements consistent with the design, none contradict it.

## 1. Status at a glance

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0 | Doctor + scaffolding | **done** — `nexus-doctor`, CI, cargo-deny gate |
| 1 | Contracts in the small | **done** — nexus-core, codec-api, nexus-sim |
| 2 | Walking skeleton | **done** — control plane + node lifecycle + data plane (serial↔PTY byte flow, presence gating, backpressure) |
| 3 | Boundaries & logging | **done** — drop counters, log node, `rotate`/`subscribe`, client-termios, high-throughput data plane + benchmark (§3.11) |
| 4 | Arbitration | **done** — slices A & B (exclusive write lock, `lock`/`unlock`, `may_write` gate, purge-on-acquire/-detach, detach-release, held, free-for-all) plus **slice C**: the FIFO waiter queue + two-lane async dispatch, `send`, `--steal`/`--wait`/`--lease-ms`, lease generation-guard, immediate lock notifications (§3.12, §6b, §15.20) |
| 5 | Codecs | **done** — codec runtime + registry (§8), the `codecs/reference` framing codec (resync), the interior codec node + exec codec (§7.5/§7.6), endpoint-keyed wiring, `nexus-sim` `mux`/`envelope`; audited (§6c, §15.22, §15.23) |
| 6 | The wire | **done** — leg node (§7.4) + v1 wire hello (§9), fragmentation, binding, faulted-and-wait/purge-on-reconnect, `nexus-sim` `wire`/`tcp-proxy`, §9 conformance scripts; audited (§6d, §15.24) |
| — | **v6 alignment** | **done** — phase 0-4 re-audited against the revised v6 design; 5 deviations fixed (empty-node-name §11, boundary comment §5, serial/PTY `hostward_buffer` + serial `modem` §7.1/§7.2, `--socket-group` §10) (§3.13) |
| 7 | Identity & resilience | **done** — resolver (§12) + faulted-and-wait/reopen (§7.1) + state file (§11) + `add-node`/`remove-node --cascade`/`load --replace` + serial-signal verbs (§7.1) + doctor P5 + `nexus-sim nullmodem`; audited (§6e, §15.25) |
| 8 | Hardening & release | **done** — macOS build+cfg-gating (cross-checked via `--target x86_64-apple-darwin`) + macOS CI lane + `docs/macos.md`; docs (README, `docs/security.md`, `docs/codec-authors.md`, `docs/rpc/`); packaging (systemd unit, udev, example config); cargo-fuzz targets (`fuzz/`, nightly); `phase8/{quickstart,agent-task,soak}.sh` + CI wiring; audited (§6f) |

**Quality gates (all green):** `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy
--workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace` (87
pass), `cargo check --target x86_64-apple-darwin --workspace` (macOS portability,
clean), and `bash scripts/validate/all.sh --through 8` (**42 pass, 0 fail**). Phase 8
scripts: `phase8/{quickstart,agent-task,soak}.sh`; phase 7
scripts: `phase7/{unplug,replug,squatter,matrix,crash-recovery,signals,p5}.sh`;
phase 6 scripts: `phase6/{reference,binding,hostility,insecure-bind,outage,head-of-line}.sh`;
phase 5 scripts: `phase5/{envelope,demux,resync,held,bad-attributes,exec-crash}.sh`;
phase 4 scripts: `phase4/{exclusivity,purge,free-for-all,held,send,steal-lease,waiting}.sh`;
phase 3 added `counters.sh`, `log.sh`, `log-enospc.sh`, `subscribe.sh`,
`firehose.sh`, `exact-loss.sh`, `benchmark.sh`.

**Hardware integration test (Tier-3, opt-in):**
`scripts/validate/hardware/crossover-rig.sh` — the first end-to-end test on *real*
silicon (design §13/§15.17/§15.21, plan §5). It requires exactly two USB-serial
adapters wired together with a crossover UART cable (else it SKIPs, exit 0, a valid
verdict) and self-judges with the usual `{"check":...,"pass":...}` line. It runs
`nexus-doctor` P5 to certify the rig FIRST (the §15.21 precondition — a failure is
attributed to a loose wire, not the daemon), then drives the daemon through the
physical rig: identity resolution both directions (§12), byte-exact bidirectional
data path (§4/§5/§7.1), the `send` verb, far-side break reception, TIOCEXCL
exclusivity, exclusive arbitration (lock→LOCKED→steal, §6), slow-consumer
drop-with-counters isolation (§5, exact `received+dropped==sent` accounting), and
observable framing/parity error counters under deliberate baud/parity mismatch. Not
in the per-push `all.sh` sweep (no hardware there); wire into a hardware CI lane if a
rig exists. Verified passing on a cross-wired FTDI FT232R pair (~47s, deterministic).

**Kernel matrix:** every kernel-behavior probe is `supported` on **Linux 7.0.0**
(dev box, Ubuntu 26.04) and **Linux 6.18.14** (Debian rodete) with **zero
deltas** — see `docs/nexus-doctor.md`. The kernel-sensitive PTY/serial mechanics
are de-risked across the support matrix.

## 2. Where the code lives

| Crate | Role | State |
|-------|------|-------|
| `codec-api` | codec trait (+ `resync_count`), event vocabulary, envelope frame codec + golden vectors, **v1 wire hello** (`WIRE_MAGIC`/`WIRE_VERSION`/`Hello`/`WireError`) (§8/§9) | done |
| `codecs/reference` (`codec-reference`) | the v1 envelope framing as a `Codec`, with length-guided resync (§7.5/§9) | done (phase 5) |
| `nexus-core` | graph model + validator (§4), data-plane deliver contracts + holdover (§5), lock state machine incl. `reclaim_held` (§6), config/state split (§15.8), **device-identity `resolver` (§12)** | done |
| `nexus-rpc` | JSON-RPC 2.0 wire types — the stable §15.16 surface | done |
| `nexus-sim` | test double: `pty`/`client`/`mux`/`envelope`/`wire`/`tcp-proxy`/`nullmodem` modes (§3) | done through phase 7 |
| `nexus-doctor` | shipping capability checker: probes P1–P4 + env checks (§15.17) | done |
| `serialnexusd` | the daemon | control plane + node lifecycle + data plane + codecs + leg/wire done |
| `serialnexusctl` | the CLI (thin RPC client + `--json`) | `load [--replace]`/`add-node`/`remove-node [--cascade]`/`dump`/`state`/`subscribe`/`rotate`/`lock`/`unlock`/`send`/`send-break`/`set-modem`/`pulse-dtr`/`teardown`/`shutdown` |

`serialnexusd` modules: `main.rs` (runtime, socket policy, shutdown),
`control.rs` (JSON-RPC over UDS), `daemon.rs` (graph state + method impls),
`runtime.rs` (endpoint-keyed data-plane `Wiring` + `LockCell` + poll-based I/O helpers),
`nodes/{mod,serial,pty,log,codec,exec,leg}.rs` (node runtimes; `codec` = the in-process
demux/remux + registry, `exec` = the child-process codec, `leg` = the cross-daemon
socket transport + link codec, §15.24), `sys.rs` (the single unsafe-bearing module:
`TIOCEXCL`/`TIOCPKT` ioctls, raw `read`/`write`/`fcntl`, and the non-blocking
`poll_ready`).

Validation scripts are the canonical exit criteria (plan §3):
`scripts/validate/phaseN/*.sh`, each self-judging with a JSON verdict and exit
code. Helpers in `scripts/lib/` (`wait-for.sh`, `semantic-diff.sh`).

## 3. Deviations & refinements from the design

These are implementation decisions the design does not spell out, or where a
kernel/library reality shaped the approach. None contradict the design.

### 3.1 Serial node uses blocking `serial2` + poll-based readiness, not `serial2-tokio`
**Design:** §13 lists `serial2`/`serial2-tokio` for "concurrent async read/write."
**Reality (nexus-doctor P3 research):** `serial2-tokio` 0.1.24 exposes **no
accessor for the inner fd**, and `serial2` **does not take `TIOCEXCL`** (only
`O_NOCTTY`). The daemon needs the raw fd for `TIOCEXCL` (§7.1) and later
`TIOCGICOUNT` (§5).
**Decision:** open a blocking `serial2::SerialPort` (settings, modem lines,
break, and the raw ioctls via `as_raw_fd`), set it non-blocking, and drive async
I/O with poll-based readiness (see §3.10) — rather than `serial2-tokio`.
Consistent with §13's "raw termios via nix/rustix as the fallback." `TIOCEXCL` is
issued by the daemon itself (`nodes/serial.rs`). `serial2-tokio` is now an unused
dependency and was dropped from `serialnexusd/Cargo.toml` — and, in the v3
realignment, from the root `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.dependencies]` as well, so the
design's "dropped during implementation" (§13, §15.1) is literally true of the
manifest.

### 3.2 PTY slave is *primed* at creation (POLLHUP never-opened refinement)
**Design:** §7.2 detects presence via the master's HUP condition.
**Reality (nexus-doctor P2):** a master whose slave was **never opened** does
**not** report `POLLHUP`; HUP only appears after the first open→close. So HUP
alone cannot represent the initial no-client state.
**Decision:** at PTY node creation, open and immediately close the slave once
(`prime_slave` in `nodes/pty.rs`). This forces the "absent" HUP state, so
presence detection via POLLHUP is uniform from the start. This step is not in the
design text; it is a faithful refinement of §7.2's model, confirmed identical on
7.0 and 6.18.

### 3.3 Data-plane holdover needs an explicit `flush` on resume
**Design:** §5 — a transform that has emitted output when downstream refuses
"parks it in its holdover slot."
**Refinement:** a chunk parked on the *last* offer would be stranded if the
runtime only retries on new origin input. `nexus-core::data::TargetwardSink` has
a `flush()` method the runtime calls when a boundary becomes writable,
independent of new input, draining parked holdovers in order. Caught by a
property test (`prop_targetward_no_loss_bounded_interior`). v4 §5 now names this
explicitly ("boundaries announce writability, and the runtime drains parked
holdover frames on that signal, independent of any new origin input").

### 3.4 `EndpointAddr` serializes as its display string
**Design:** §3/§15.12 — display form is `node/channel`; neither part contains `/`.
**Decision:** in configuration, an endpoint address serializes as that **string**
(`"usb0"` or `"mux/console"`), not a nested `{node, endpoint}` table. This keeps
edges all-scalar and TOML-clean and makes configs read the way operators write
them. The design does not specify the on-disk encoding of an address; this is a
presentation choice. (`nexus-core::graph::EndpointAddr`.)

### 3.5 JSON-RPC `id: null` and result-XOR-error validation
**Design:** §10 — hand-rolled JSON-RPC 2.0.
**Refinement (from an adversarial review):** `nexus-rpc` now has an `Id::Null`
variant and `Response::error_without_id`, so a parse-error / invalid-request
reply carries the spec-mandated `id: null` (JSON-RPC 2.0 §5) and never desyncs a
client's read stream; and `Response`'s deserializer enforces exactly-one-of
`result`/`error` (distinguishing a present `result: null` from an absent one).
Completes §10's contract; not a deviation.

### 3.6 `load` RPC carries the config as JSON, not TOML text
**Design:** §10 — "Configuration files are TOML; the RPC carries JSON."
**Decision:** `serialnexusctl` reads the `.toml` file, parses it to
`GraphConfig`, and sends `{"config": <GraphConfig as JSON>}` in the `load`
params; `dump` returns the config as JSON and the CLI renders TOML. The CLI owns
the TOML↔JSON conversion (presentation, §15.16); the daemon speaks only JSON.

### 3.7 Daemon-specific error codes
`load` on a non-empty graph → `-32001`; a structural validation failure →
`-32002` (with all offenders in `error.data.errors`). Both in the reserved
application range `[-32099, -32000]` (§10). `nexus-rpc::error_codes` unchanged.

### 3.8 `advertised_baud` maps to standard rates only
PTY `advertised_baud` is cosmetic (§7.2). nix on Linux sets termios speed via a
`BaudRate` enum (standard rates only), so a non-standard advertised baud is
skipped rather than approximated. (`nodes/pty.rs::standard_baud`.)

### 3.9 Unimplemented node kinds were a structural load error (resolved in phase 3)
Before phase 3, a configuration containing a **log** node was rejected at load
(`node <name>: log nodes land in phase 3`), nothing created — a build-stage
limitation, not a design position. Phase 3 (slice B) implemented the log node and
removed the rejection; a log node now loads normally. Kept here only as a record.

### 3.10 Data-plane readiness is poll-based, not `tokio::AsyncFd` (the pty-master spin)
**Design:** §5 — a single-threaded async data plane; the design does not name a
readiness mechanism.
**Reality (found while wiring slice 2):** `tokio::io::unix::AsyncFd` (epoll)
**spuriously and persistently reports a pty master readable** once an external
client is attached — `readable()` returns ready every poll while `read(2)` gives
`EAGAIN` and a direct `poll(2)` reports *no* readiness (epoll disagrees with
`poll`). Because `readable()` completing synchronously never yields, this
busy-loops and **starves the entire current-thread runtime** (every other task,
including the control plane, freezes until an unrelated I/O event — e.g. the
client disconnecting — breaks the loop). Reproduced in isolation; independent of
packet mode, the sync presence poll, shared-vs-dup fds, and `select!`. It is a
genuine epoll/pty-master quirk, and `AsyncFd` is unsuitable for these fds.
**Decision:** drive readiness with a **non-blocking `poll(2)`** (`sys::poll_ready`,
zero timeout — returns immediately, never blocks the thread) plus a short async
`tokio::time::sleep` (`runtime::IDLE_POLL`, 5 ms) only when idle. During an active
transfer a task re-polls immediately after each full drain, so the interval
bounds idle latency (and idle CPU — measured ~1%), never throughput (1 MiB
echo round-trips in ~0.5 s). Reads: `poll(POLLIN|POLLHUP)` → drain to `WouldBlock`.
Writes: `write(2)` then, on `WouldBlock`, `poll(POLLOUT|POLLHUP)` + sleep. This
applies to **both** node types uniformly (`runtime.rs`, `nodes/{pty,serial}.rs`);
a real UART tolerates epoll but the daemon must also drive the PTY master and
(in tests) pts-backed "devices", so one poll-based path is simplest.
**Future:** idle CPU is a fixed ~1%/idle-fd today; a longer or adaptive idle
interval, or a `spawn_blocking` reader thread for high-baud serial, is a phase-3
optimization if the throughput benchmark demands it. `AsyncFd` is *not* the
answer for pty masters.

### 3.11 The phase-3 benchmark demanded §15.18's thread escape hatch (both axes)
**Design:** §15.18 frames the poll(2) readiness as bounding "idle latency, never
throughput" (re-poll immediately during active transfer), with `spawn_blocking`
reader threads as an escape hatch *if the benchmark demands it*, and idle CPU as
the named concern (~1%/idle-fd).
**Reality (phase-3 benchmark):** on the current-thread runtime the "re-poll
immediately" intuition does **not** hold for a peer in a *separate process* — a
`yield_now` spin returns instantly (no other runnable task), so no wall-clock
passes and the peer never refills; the wait therefore always pays the ~1 ms tokio
timer floor per buffer cycle, capping hostward throughput at **~1 MB/s** (measured
1.2 MiB/s serial→log). That is below even one 3 Mbaud port for a fast consumer —
so the escape hatch was **required**, not optional, exactly as §15.18 reserved.
**Decision:** the two high-throughput paths — the **serial hostward reader** and
the **PTY hostward writer** — run on **dedicated blocking threads** doing a
*blocking* `poll(2)` (`sys::poll_blocking`), which the kernel wakes the instant
the fd is ready. Result: ~185 MiB/s, lossless, and **zero** CPU while parked
(a blocked poll costs nothing — this also dissolves the idle-CPU concern for
these fds). Cross-thread counters became atomics (`Rc`→`Arc`, `Cell`→`Atomic*`);
the PTY writer is fed by an async pump through a **bounded** bridge so the buffer
stays bounded and full-buffer drops are counted. Low-rate paths (targetward
PTY→serial, PTY presence/termios) stay async poll-based, now with an
`ACTIVE_POLL`→`IDLE_POLL` adaptive backoff → **~0.06%/idle-fd** (2% total for 32
idle PTYs, well under budget; the §15.18 idle-CPU concern, resolved).
**Recorded:** `docs/benchmarks/phase3.json` (throughput + idle axes);
`scripts/validate/phase3/{firehose,exact-loss,benchmark}.sh`. **Folded into the
design in v4:** this decision is now ADR **§15.19** and §5's "hybrid" paragraph,
and §15.18's "never throughput" claim is corrected there (it held only until the
hot hostward path moved to a blocking thread). The design pass this section asked
for is done; the code comments were repointed from §15.18 to §15.19 to match.

### 3.12 Arbitration addressing: `lock`/`unlock` name the origin, not the endpoint
**Design:** §6 shows `serialnexusctl lock <node/channel>` and `send <node/channel>`
without pinning down whether `<node/channel>` is the origin acquiring the lock or
the host-facing endpoint being locked.
**Decision (phase 4, slice A):** the lock lives on a **host-facing endpoint** (the
serial node), but the RPC `lock`/`unlock` name the **origin** — the target-facing
writer (a PTY) that acquires it. The daemon resolves the origin to the unique
endpoint it feeds (a target-facing endpoint has exactly one edge, §4). This is what
makes the reference workflow coherent: `lock ptya` grants *ptya* the write lock so
its operator can type, while other origins on the same serial are locked out. The
later `send` verb (slice C) instead names the **target** endpoint, since the CLI is
itself the transient origin. This is a presentation/RPC-shape choice the design
leaves open (§15.16); the state machine (`nexus_core::lock`) is addressing-agnostic
(it keys on an opaque `OriginId`), so a future spelling change costs only the daemon
glue. **Architecture:** the lock is a pure state machine in `nexus_core::lock`
(property-tested); the daemon shares one `Rc<RefCell<EndpointLock>>` per endpoint
(all tasks are on the one runtime thread) between the control-plane methods that
mutate it and each origin's PTY read task, which consults `may_write` before
draining targetward. A non-holder is *not read from* (its bytes stay in the kernel
buffer — backpressure, never dropped), so arbitration reuses the §5 pause machinery
and adds no data path, exactly as §6 requires. The serial node's host endpoint
carries a new `arbitration = exclusive | free-for-all` config attribute (§6).
**Purge-on-acquire runs synchronously in the daemon's `lock` at grant time**
(draining the origin's master fd via `Node::purge_origin` before the grant reply
returns), *not* lazily in the reader task — a lazy drain would race a correct
acquire-before-write client's first command and discard it (caught by an
adversarial review; guarded by `phase4/purge.sh` check 3).

**Known limitation — sub-poll close+reopen (poll-based presence).** Detach-release
and purge-on-detach hinge on observing the PTY's present→absent transition via
level `POLLHUP` (§7.2). If a client closes and a *different* client reopens the
same slave within one poll interval (≤ `IDLE_POLL`, 5 ms for a quiescent origin),
the transition is unobservable — the successor inherits the predecessor's lock
without an explicit re-acquire, and the baseline termios is not re-asserted. This
is inherent to poll-based presence (the §15.18/§15.19 tradeoff), not a logic bug;
it affects only the detach-release path (an explicit `unlock` is unaffected) and
never lets a *different endpoint's* origin write (exclusion still holds). A
per-open generation/epoch would close it if it ever matters; deferred.

### 3.13 Node config surface completed to match §7.1/§7.2/§10 (v6 alignment)
**Design:** §7.1 lists a serial node's Configuration as including *initial modem-line
assertions* and a *hostward-consumer drop policy*; §7.2 lists a PTY's as including a
*hostward drop policy*; §10 lists *flags to widen the control socket to a group*. These
attributes were specified in v1 but never built (the text is identical in v5/v6); a v6
alignment audit flagged the config-surface gap and the user directed building them.
**Decision (mapping each design attribute to the real boundary buffer):**
- **Serial `hostward_buffer`** (`usize`, default 256) — the depth of the per-consumer
  *fan-out channel* the serial reader `try_send`s into (§5 "bounded buffering where
  configured"). Plumbed in `runtime::Wiring::build` (a serial node's depth overrides
  `CHANNEL_CAP` for edges it produces; other producers keep the default). Hostward is
  always lossy-with-counters, never `fault` — a slow spy must cost only itself (§5) — so
  the only tunable is depth (a scalar), unlike the log node's `{drop-oldest|fault}`.
- **Serial `modem`** (`ModemLines { dtr: Option<bool>, rts: Option<bool> }`, default both
  `None` = untouched) — initial DTR/RTS assertions applied in `open_port` after
  `TIOCEXCL` (serial2 `set_dtr`/`set_rts`); a `None` line keeps the driver's power-on
  state, so the default is exactly today's behavior. Stored on `SerialNode` so phase 7's
  reopen ritual restores it against auto-reset adapters (§7.1). Serialized as a *trailing
  table* (after the scalar fields, like a codec's `attributes`) and skipped when unset.
- **PTY `hostward_buffer`** (`usize`, default 32) — the depth of the PTY's internal
  *writer-bridge* `sync_channel` (§5); replaces the former `WRITER_QUEUE` const.
- **`--socket-group <name>`** — resolves the group (hard error if absent), chgrps the
  control socket, and relaxes its mode to 0660; unset keeps the 0600 owner-only default
  (§10). Mirrors the PTY slave's group logic (§7.2).
The three drop-policy mentions (serial §7.1, PTY §7.2, log §7.3) thus map to three
*distinct* real buffers — producer fan-out, consumer writer-bridge, and the log file
queue — so listing a policy on both producer and consumer is not redundant. All default
to current behavior; validation is unchanged; round-trip is pinned by
`serial_and_pty_hostward_and_modem_round_trip` and the config proptest (generators now
vary `hostward_buffer` and `modem`).

## 4. Findings carried forward (from nexus-doctor)

Full report: `docs/nexus-doctor.md`. Re-runnable per system with
`cargo run -p nexus-doctor` (Markdown) / `--json | jq -e -f expectations/linux.jq`.

- **P1 EXTPROC/TIOCPKT — supported (7.0 & 6.18).** Packet-mode observation is the
  primary path; the §7.2 reconciliation poll remains an unconditional backstop
  (kept live regardless — do not delete it because a probe passed).
- **P2 PTY presence — supported.** Drives the slave-priming refinement (§3.2).
- **P3 serial fit — supported on real FTDI.** Custom baud (exact), `TIOCEXCL`,
  modem lines, break, `TIOCGICOUNT` all confirmed. Drives §3.1.
- **P4 by-id resolution — supported.** Canonical `usb:vid:pid:serial:iface` via a
  dependency-free sysfs *ancestor* walk (nearest `bInterfaceNumber` = interface;
  first `idVendor` = device — stop there or you bind the root hub). This is the
  reusable core of the phase-7 resolver.

## 5. How to build, test, run

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
bash scripts/validate/all.sh --through 2      # every phase gate so far

# Capability report on this machine (attach to any bug report):
cargo run -p nexus-doctor                      # Markdown
cargo run -p nexus-doctor -- --port /dev/ttyUSB0   # include P3 on a real port

# Drive the daemon by hand (use a SHORT socket dir — see §7):
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$(mktemp -d /tmp/snx.XXXXXX)
./target/debug/serialnexusd &                  # or --config demo.toml, --socket PATH
./target/debug/serialnexusctl load demo.toml
./target/debug/serialnexusctl --json state
./target/debug/serialnexusctl dump
./target/debug/serialnexusctl shutdown
```

A minimal `demo.toml` (serial→PTY fan of one):
```toml
[[node]]
type = "pty"
name = "console"
path = "/tmp/snx/console"
[[node]]
type = "serial"
name = "usb0"
device = "/dev/ttyUSB0"     # or a `nexus-sim pty --echo --link` path
[[edge]]
a = "usb0"
b = "console"
```

---

## 6. Phase 2 slice 2 (the data plane) — DONE

Real bytes flow serial↔PTY through a configured daemon over RPC. As built:

- **Readiness (§3.10):** poll-based, *not* `AsyncFd`. Each boundary fd is set
  `O_NONBLOCK`; a task drains via `sys::poll_ready` + `sys::read_fd`/`write_fd`,
  sleeping `runtime::IDLE_POLL` (5 ms) only when idle.
- **Hostward (serial→PTY):** serial read → `try_send` into each attached PTY's
  bounded channel (drop-on-full = lossy at the boundary, §5); the PTY writer
  drains to the master, **presence-gated** (discard when no client).
- **Targetward (PTY→serial):** PTY read → `send().await` into the serial's bounded
  channel (lossless + backpressure: a full channel pauses the reader; the kernel
  buffers on the client side, §5).
- **Packet mode:** the leading `TIOCPKT` byte is stripped on every master read;
  only `TIOCPKT_DATA` (`sys::TIOCPKT_DATA`) payloads are forwarded. `TIOCPKT_IOCTL`
  (client-termios reconciliation into state) is still `#[allow(dead_code)]` — a
  later phase surfaces client termios; the data plane just drops control packets.
- **Presence:** per-PTY `client_present: Rc<Cell<bool>>` driven by the same 5 ms
  `POLLHUP` poll; reads are gated on presence, and on last close the baseline
  termios is re-asserted (§7.2). Feeds `PtyNode::state_extra`.
- **Wiring:** `runtime::Wiring::build` derives the channels from the validated
  edges; `daemon::load` starts each node via `Node::start` (`spawn_local` on the
  `LocalSet`). Teardown/Drop abort the tasks and close the fds.
- **`nexus-sim`:** `client --report-termios` opens the daemon's PTY and reports
  its termios *without* disturbing it (verifies the §7.2 baseline end to end).
- **Validated by `scripts/validate/phase2/data-path.sh`:** 64 KiB seeded echo
  round-trip (checksums intact), both nodes `active`, baseline termios from the
  client's side (raw/echo-off/EXTPROC), and `client_present` true↔false
  transitions. Measured ad-hoc: ~1% idle CPU, 1 MiB echo in ~0.5 s.

## 6a. Phase 3 (boundaries and logging) — DONE

Built in four committed slices: **A** boundary drop counters + serial discard +
`TIOCGICOUNT` (`e064025`); **B** the log node — bounded queue, dedicated blocking
writer thread, on-demand `rotate`, counter recovery by directory scan, ENOSPC
fault; removed the §3.9 log-load rejection (`04b394d`); **C** `subscribe`
(broadcast + periodic snapshot) and client-termios surfacing via the
`TIOCPKT_IOCTL` path (`86ff94c`); **D** the high-throughput data plane (§3.11:
serial reader + PTY writer on dedicated blocking threads) with the firehose,
exact-loss, and throughput/idle benchmark (`c4d0e64`). All validated by
self-judging `scripts/validate/phase3/*.sh`; `docs/benchmarks/phase3.json` records
the throughput (~185 MiB/s) and idle (2% for 32 fds) axes.

## 6b. Phase 4 (arbitration) — COMPLETE

Per plan §Phase 4, built in slices; test topology needs no codec (PTYs on one
serial endpoint is a legal §4 fan-out).

- **Slice A DONE: the exclusive write lock.** `nexus_core::lock::EndpointLock` —
  the pure, property-tested state machine (holder, per-origin write modes, purge
  accounting; `may_write` is the gate). Serial node gains an `arbitration` config
  attribute (§6). `Wiring::build` creates one `Rc<RefCell<EndpointLock>>` per
  host-facing endpoint and registers every edge as an origin (a log/`never` edge is
  a non-writer). Each writing PTY's read task gates its targetward drain on
  `may_write` — a non-holder is **not read from** (backpressure, no drop, §5/§6).
  `lock`/`unlock` RPC (address the **origin**, §3.12) with `-32003` LOCKED for a
  contended acquire; the host endpoint reports `.lock` (arbitration, holder,
  origins, purge) in `state`. CLI `lock`/`unlock`. Validated by
  `phase4/exclusivity.sh` (byte-exact: only the holder's stream reaches the sink;
  a locked-out present writer and a `write=never` spy leak nothing — verified with
  a negative control that a disabled gate makes the test fail).
  - **Consequence — exclusive is the default (§6), so a lone PTY needs a lock to
    write.** `only the holder's bytes are read targetward` holds even with one
    origin: an on-demand PTY that has not acquired the lock is not read from. This
    (correctly) broke five pre-arbitration phase-2/3 tests that wrote targetward
    (`--expect echo`) or changed termios without locking. They now set
    `arbitration = "free-for-all"` on their serial node — §6's documented opt-out
    — to keep testing the data plane / logging / termios (their actual subject)
    without arbitration ceremony; the exclusive-lock path is covered by
    `phase4/exclusivity.sh`. Real single-console operators have the same choice:
    `free-for-all`, or the "grab, write, release" flow.
- **Slice B DONE: purge + detach-release + free-for-all e2e.** The PTY reader
  (`nodes/pty.rs::read_and_poll`) was restructured: it now drains available data
  for any `may_write` writer **regardless of a simultaneous `POLLHUP`** (so a
  closing writer's residual is forwarded, not lost), and the present→absent
  transition is handled once, post-drain, by `handle_last_close` — the holder
  releases (detach-release), an **exclusive non-holder's** buffered backlog is
  drained+counted (purge-on-detach), and a free-for-all writer keeps its bytes.
  Purge-on-acquire runs **synchronously in `daemon::lock`** at grant time
  (exclusive only), draining+counting the pre-grant backlog via `Node::purge_origin`
  *before the grant reply returns*; a held holder keeps the lock across a client
  detach. Purge counters surface in `state` as `.lock.origins[].purged`. Bugs caught
  & fixed during build-out and an adversarial multi-agent review (details in §3.12):
  a closing free-for-all writer's residual was purged not forwarded; a lingering
  `TIOCPKT_IOCTL` re-populated `client_termios` after last-close; the purge-on-acquire
  drain was initially in the async reader and raced a correct acquire-then-write
  client (moved to the daemon); a held holder was wrongly detach-released. Validated
  by `phase4/{purge,free-for-all,held}.sh` (purge counts exact, post-grant survives,
  two free-for-all writers both reach the device, held keeps its lock);
  `exclusivity.sh` now also asserts detach-release.

- **Slice C DONE: waiting verbs + the two-lane control plane (§6, §10, §15.20).**
  - **Pure lock (`nexus_core::lock`):** `EndpointLock` gained a FIFO `waiters`
    queue, a grant `generation`, `steal`, and `renew`. `acquire` is now queue-aware
    — it grants a free lock **only to the FIFO head** (barge prevention), naming an
    earlier waiter in `Denied { held_by }`. New pure API: `enqueue`/`dequeue`/`steal`
    /`renew`/`generation`/`waiters`; `snapshot()` now carries `waiters` and
    `last_steal`. 14 unit/property tests (the invariant proptest gained enqueue/
    dequeue/steal ops, generation-monotonicity, and holder-never-queued).
  - **`LockCell` (`runtime.rs`):** `SharedLock` is now `Rc<LockCell>` =
    `RefCell<EndpointLock>` + a `tokio::sync::Notify` (wakes queued waiters) + the
    `subscribe` broadcast sender + a `closed` flag. `wake_waiters`/`notified`/
    `emit_change`/`close`/`is_closed`. `Wiring::build` takes the notifier and creates
    **one targetward channel per host endpoint up front** (`endpoint_targetward`), so
    `send` works even with no PTY writer attached.
  - **Two-lane dispatch (`daemon.rs`, §15.20):** `Daemon::dispatch` is now `async`;
    `lock`/`send` are async, `unlock` stays sync. `wait_for_grant` is the waiting
    lane — it enables the `Notify` future **before** the acquire check (lost-wakeup-
    free), enqueues on `Denied`, and suspends on `notified`/deadline holding no
    borrow. The **`RefCell` borrow never crosses an `.await`** tripwire holds
    throughout (every borrow is a `{}` block dropped before the await; purge drains
    the fd synchronously). `WaiterGuard`/`TransientOrigin` are `Drop` guards that
    dequeue/unregister on cancellation. Immediate id-less `lock` notifications fire
    on every transition (acquire/release/steal/lease-expiry/detach-release) via
    `LockCell::emit_change`; the 200 ms snapshot is only an observability floor.
  - **`send <endpoint> --line`:** names the **endpoint**; the CLI is a transient
    origin (synthetic id from `SEND_ORIGIN_BASE = 1<<40`). register → acquire-with-
    timeout (default 2000 ms, `--timeout-ms`) or `--steal` → write `line + "\n"`
    targetward → release + unregister. Always cleaned up (guard) on timeout or a
    dropped connection.
  - **`control.rs` cancel-on-disconnect:** `serve_connection` races the (maybe-
    waiting) dispatch future against a second `lines.next_line()` in a
    `tokio::select! { biased; … }` — `biased` so a ready fast verb is never pre-
    empted by a spuriously-read next request, and a dropped connection cancels a
    `--wait` (dropping the dispatch future runs the guard).
  - **`nodes/pty.rs`:** `handle_last_close` now `wake_waiters()` + `emit_change()`
    after a detach-release / purge-on-detach, so a queued `--wait` waiter is granted
    on the detach-release path.
  - **Three bugs caught by the slice-C adversarial review & fixed** (regression-
    covered): (1) **lease re-arm** — a second `lock --lease-ms` hit `AlreadyHeld`
    without advancing the generation, so the *earlier* (shorter) timer still fired
    and released the grant; now `renew` bumps the generation on re-arm, invalidating
    the prior timer (`steal-lease.sh` check 4). (2) **teardown stranded parked
    waiters** — a deadline-less `lock --wait` hung forever when its endpoint was
    torn down; `teardown` now `close()`s every lock cell (which wakes waiters) and
    `wait_for_grant` returns a defined `Closed` error (`waiting.sh` sub-check D).
    (3) **steal didn't wake a same-origin `--wait`** — a `lock X --steal` from one
    connection left a `lock X --wait` on another parked; both steal paths now
    `wake_waiters()`.
  - **Validated:** `phase4/{send,steal-lease,waiting}.sh` (plan items 5, 4, 7):
    send LOCKED-then-steal byte-exact; steal record + immediate notification; lease
    auto-release, stale-timer-never-fires, and renewal-extends; FIFO across an unlock
    **and** a detach-release with byte-exact purge-on-acquire on the queued grant,
    kill-waiter-dequeues, deadline-send-queue-intact, teardown-wakes-waiter.

## 6c. Phase 5 (codecs) — COMPLETE

The interior codec node — the first node with more than one endpoint and the first
non-two-layer topology. Built in three slices, then an adversarial audit fixed 14
findings.

- **Slice A — pure contracts + reference codec + sim modes.** `nexus-core` gained the
  `NodeConfig::Codec` variant (codec name, `faces`, channel list, opaque `attributes`
  table; multiplexed side = the default/empty endpoint, channels = identities) and the
  shape/validation; `Eq` was dropped from `GraphConfig`/`NodeConfig` (a `toml::Table`
  carries floats — only `PartialEq`; nothing needed `Eq`). New crate
  **`codecs/reference`** (`codec-reference`): the v1 envelope framing as a `Codec`,
  with **length-guided resync** — on a body-decode error with an intact length prefix,
  skip exactly `4 + body_len` and count one framing error; only a mangled length prefix
  is unrecoverable, and the reliable-transport link codec (phase 6) never hits it, so
  §8's one shared frame format holds. `nexus-sim` grew **`mux`** (round-robin
  seeded per-channel data → reference frames, `--corrupt-every`, a deterministic
  `--manifest` oracle, and a `--wait-file` feed gate so presence-gated channel PTYs
  don't miss the burst) and **`envelope`** (drives an external codec child through the
  golden-vector battery). Fixture: `tests/ext-codec/passthrough.py`. Validated by
  `phase5/envelope.sh` (item 3). The graph validator gained `DuplicateEndpoint`
  (empty/duplicate channel identity) — a slice-A adversarial review found the codec was
  the first node that could hit it.
- **Slice B — endpoint-keyed wiring + codec node (demux/resync/held).** `Wiring` was
  generalized from node-keyed (serial→consumer) to **endpoint-keyed** (`EndpointAddr`):
  every host-facing endpoint gets a lock + fan-out + one arbitrated targetward channel;
  every target-facing endpoint is a single-producer consumer that may write back. Only
  the `Node::start` dispatcher and `Wiring` changed — serial/pty/log `start` signatures
  are untouched. The daemon converts the endpoint-keyed maps to display-string keys for
  the RPC surface (`usb0`, `mux/console`) and reports each host endpoint's lock as
  `.lock` (serial) or `.channels[ch].lock` (codec). `nodes/codec.rs`: a hostward demux
  task (raw → per-channel `data` → fan-out) and one targetward mux task per channel
  (frame → serial, gated on the codec holding the serial lock). The demux edge holds
  the serial lock (`held`); a steal ousts it, and the channel task **reclaims with
  priority** once the stealer releases. Registry `build_codec` (match-on-name behind a
  `codec-reference` Cargo feature); a bad codec name / attribute schema is structural
  (aborts the load, nothing created). Validated by `phase5/{demux,resync,held,
  bad-attributes}.sh` (items 1, 2, 6, 5). **Remux (`faces = host`) is deferred to
  phase 6** — it needs a leg to drive; such a node loads and comes up faulted.
- **Slice C — exec codec.** `nodes/exec.rs`: a child process speaking the envelope on
  stdin/stdout, the multiplexed side on the **reserved empty channel** (ADR §15.22). A
  supervisor spawns the child, pumps both directions, and restarts with backoff on
  crash (restart count is observable); stderr → tracing. Validated by
  `phase5/exec-crash.sh` (item 4): a 256 KiB echo round-trip through the codec, `kill
  -9`, restart, clean resume, with an unrelated serial echo healthy throughout.
- **⚠️ Audit fixes (14 confirmed; do NOT regress).** (1) **CRITICAL exec-pump
  deadlock** — the single `select!` coupled stdin-write and stdout-read; under
  sustained flow (>64 KB) the child filled stdout and blocked on stdin while the daemon
  blocked writing stdin. **Fixed:** `pump_child` runs stdin-feeding and stdout-reading
  (and stderr) as **concurrently-polled** futures in one `select!`, so a blocked
  `write_all` never starves the stdout reader. The 256 KiB round-trip in `exec-crash.sh`
  is the regression guard — do NOT collapse the two directions back into one branch.
  (2) **Held re-acquire was FIFO** — a non-held `--wait` waiter could inherit the mux
  lock and corrupt framing. **Fixed:** `EndpointLock::reclaim_held` grants a held origin
  the free lock ahead of on-demand waiters (§6 "held indefinitely"); `ensure_holds`
  uses it. (3) **Duplicate node names** silently collapsed in the shape map →
  `ValidationError::DuplicateNodeName` + `GraphConfig::validate()` (checks the node
  *list* before the model's HashMap collapses it; `load` calls it). (4) Mux-side
  hostward drop counter now surfaced as `.multiplexed.dropped_slow_consumer` (§5 loss
  attribution). (5) A configured-but-unattached channel discards-with-count
  (`discarded_unattached`) instead of over-counting `delivered_hostward`. Plus the
  exec teardown-vs-crash discriminator is now an explicit `PumpEnd` outcome (not a
  `src_rx.is_closed()` heuristic), the stderr reader is a pump future (no leaked task),
  and doc corrections (§3 default endpoint, §15.22/§15.23, `daemon.rs`/`codec.rs`
  docstrings). Two audit findings were **rejected** on verification (an oversize-mux
  drop that can't be constructed since `MAX_FRAME_SIZE == READ_BUF`, and a
  resync-as-link-codec worry that doesn't apply — the link codec never resyncs).
  **Note:** the phase-6 audit re-examined the first rejection and found the oversize
  drop *is* reachable for a non-codec-bounded producer (the leg's `send` verb, and
  the exec node's raw device stream) — see §6d; both are now fixed by fragmentation.

## 6d. Phase 6 (the wire / leg node) — COMPLETE

The cross-daemon transport (§7.4/§9/§15.24). Built as one coherent slice (config +
wire contracts, then the leg node, then the six validation scripts), then an
adversarial audit fixed 17 findings.

- **Wire contracts (`codec-api`).** The v1 **hello** frame: `WIRE_MAGIC` (`0x534E584C`
  "SNXL"), `WIRE_VERSION = 1` (versioned independently of `ENVELOPE_VERSION`), a `u32`
  capability bitset (`CAP_LOCK_RELAY = 1<<0` reserved, negotiated none in v1),
  `Hello{version,capabilities,channels}`, `encode_hello`/`try_decode_hello`,
  `WireError`. A distinct wire construct (not a fifth `EventKind`), so the four golden
  vectors stay byte-frozen; it reuses the envelope's `u32` length prefix, and its body
  begins with the magic so it never collides with a data frame. `try_decode_hello`
  validates the version-stable magic+version prefix *before* the v1 12-byte header, so
  a version mismatch is always refused as such (audit fix).
- **Config (`nexus-core`).** `NodeConfig::Leg` (+ `Transport`/`LegRole`); `shape()`
  emits one endpoint per channel, all facing `faces`, **no default endpoint** (the
  socket is off-graph); host-facing channels carry the leg's arbitration.
  `GraphConfig::validate` gained the loopback-only check (tcp non-loopback needs
  `insecure_bind`; unix exempt), empty-channel-identity and empty-channel-*list*
  rejection → `ValidationError::{NonLoopbackBind, EmptyLeg}` (+ the existing
  `DuplicateEndpoint` for empty identities). `is_loopback_addr` handles `host:port`,
  bracketed/ bare IPv6, `localhost`, and wildcard binds. The leg plugs into the
  §15.23 endpoint-keyed `Wiring` with **zero `Wiring::build` change** — via `shape()`.
- **The leg node (`nodes/leg.rs`).** A supervisor task (mirroring the exec supervisor)
  does connect-with-backoff / listen-accept-one, the hello handshake (both send then
  read, under one overall deadline), binding, and per-connection pump. The pump runs
  the socket **read and write halves concurrently** (the §15.22 lesson). `faces=target`
  (sender): drains the local hostward stream onto the wire and writes wire-arriving
  targetward as an **on-demand origin** (implicit acquire; release on idle *or*
  disconnect via a shared `Notify`; never `held`, exempt from purge-on-acquire).
  `faces=host` (receiver): fans wire data hostward (lossy `try_send`+counters) and
  drains the arbitrated targetward stream onto the wire. **The link codec fragments,
  never drops** an oversize chunk. Binding: `bound`/`waiting`/`unbound` are
  leg-internal state; a `waiting` channel's targetward writers backpressure (not sent
  to be dropped at the peer). Outage = faulted-and-wait: reconnect backoff, listen
  reject-extras, park the receivers, purge-on-reconnect (faces=host targetward
  backlog), and park the SEND half — not tear down — when local producers close.
- **`nexus-sim`.** `wire` (hostile-or-conforming peer: crafted `--hello-version`,
  `--bad-magic`, `--oversize-frame`, `--unknown-type`, `--echo`, `--send`, `--stall`)
  and `tcp-proxy` (`--drop-after`/`--restore-after` outage injection) modes; `pty
  --stall`.
- **Validated:** `phase6/{reference,binding,hostility,insecure-bind,outage,
  head-of-line}.sh` (plan items 1–6): two-daemon reference topology (per-channel
  bidirectional checksums), bound/waiting/unbound, the §9 clean-refusal battery +
  heal, the loopback gate + insecure marker, tcp-proxy outage + purge-on-reconnect,
  and the whole-connection head-of-line property (targetward freezes together,
  hostward advances).
- **⚠️ Audit fixes (17 confirmed; do NOT regress).** (1) **CRITICAL §5/§9
  targetward-no-drop violation** — the write half `continue`d on an oversize-frame
  encode error, silently dropping (uncounted) any chunk whose framed size exceeded
  `MAX_FRAME_SIZE`; reachable via the uncapped `send` verb and codec-emitted chunks
  (`READ_BUF == MAX_FRAME_SIZE`). **Fixed** by fragmenting oversize chunks across
  consecutive `data` frames in `leg.rs` (and the same idiom in `exec.rs`'s stdin feed
  for the raw device stream); verified with a 100 001-byte `send` round-trip
  (byte-exact, `discarded_hostward == 0`). Do NOT reinstate the `continue`-on-encode-
  error drop. (2) **Stale-status wedge** — a `faces=target` leg whose local producers
  all closed returned `SourceClosed` and left status `Active` forever, killing the
  independent targetward direction; **fixed** by parking the write half (removed
  `PumpEnd::SourceClosed`) so the wire/read half stay live. (3) On-demand lock
  **released on peer disconnect** now, not only after idle (a `Notify` the supervisor
  pulses). (4) Handshake bounded by **one overall deadline** (a trickling peer no
  longer wedges a listen leg). (5) `waiting`-channel targetward is **gated (not
  muxed-then-dropped-at-peer)** — `next_send` skips unbound channels so their writers
  backpressure. Plus: `insecure_bind` surfaced in `state`; configured-but-unattached
  channel drops counted (`discarded_hostward`); empty-channel-list rejected; the
  hello magic/version-first decode order; and test-fidelity fixes (head-of-line
  positive lower bound + honest comment; sim wire hello honors `--timeout-ms`). No
  findings were rejected.

## 6e. Phase 7 (identity & resilience) — COMPLETE

Built in seven slices (§12/§7.1/§11/§10 + doctor P5), then an adversarial audit
fixed 5 findings. New ADR **§15.25**; §11/§14 touched (state-file path policy,
deferred `connect`/`disconnect`/`set-attribute`).

- **The resolver (`nexus-core/src/resolver.rs`, §12).** A dependency-free (no
  libudev) module lifting the doctor's P4 sysfs walk into shared code — the doctor
  P4 probe now consumes it (`Resolver::with_roots(...).discover_adapters()`). Rooted
  by a `dev_root` whose `sys_root = dev_root/sys`, so a single `--dev-root` selects a
  self-contained fixture (`/` → `/sys` in production). Two directions:
  `resolve_input` (add-time: raw path / bare serial capture requires presence;
  `usb:`/`by-path:`/`raw:` identities never do) and `resolve_current_path`
  (open/recheck; a `usb:` identity resolves only to a device whose sysfs identity
  matches exactly → **squatter refusal by construction**). Fallback chain
  usb→by-path→raw with instability warnings; **absent OR duplicated non-empty
  serials degrade to by-path** (the §15.10 wrong-device guard, made concrete).
- **Serial faulted-and-wait + reopen ritual (`nodes/serial.rs`, §7.1).** Rewritten
  around `SerialShared{status,port}` (`Rc<RefCell>`, read by `&self`) + a `ReaderSlot`.
  **One async supervisor per node** drives the targetward writer AND the reconnect
  poll; the dedicated blocking-thread reader (§15.19) pulses a `Notify` on device
  loss (POLLHUP/EOF/error), the supervisor joins it, transitions to `waiting`, and
  polls `resolve_current_path` (~1 s) for the **same identity**. On reappearance the
  reopen ritual reapplies termios, retakes `TIOCEXCL`, restores modem lines, sets
  non-blocking, and re-arms; **purge-on-reconnect** drains the parked targetward
  channel with a counter (the one sanctioned targetward drop; origin buffers stay
  the lock-purge's job, §6). fd-reuse-safe (reader joined before the port drops);
  `WriterClosed` keeps hostward alive when targetward senders drop (§15.24 lesson).
  New serial config field `purge_on_reconnect` (default on). **Test-fidelity:** a
  finite `nexus-sim pty --source` now CORRECTLY faults-and-waits when it closes —
  `pty --hold-ms` was wired to keep the device "plugged in"; `subscribe.sh` uses it;
  `log.sh` Check 3 now relies on **auto-recovery** (below) instead of a manual reload.
- **State file (`daemon.rs`/`main.rs`, §11/§15.9).** `Daemon::snapshot_config` writes
  config (TOML, atomic tmp+rename) after every config-mutating verb (dispatch-gated by
  `is_config_mutation`, NOT on read/arbitration traffic). Startup **prefers the state
  file** over `--config`. Default path is **socket-adjacent** (`<socket>.state.toml`)
  — session-durable + restart-recovering, and per-daemon-unique so it never leaks
  across test daemons or into `$HOME`; `--state-file` gives reboot durability. Clean
  shutdown (`teardown_all`) does NOT persist an empty graph (preserves it for restart);
  the `teardown` VERB does. Write failure is logged, never corrupts the running graph.
- **Incremental verbs (`daemon.rs` + CLI).** `add-node` (resolver echo-back
  `{identity,description,kind,warning}`; path/serial absent → `DEVICE_ABSENT`; identity
  absent → waiting; wires an edgeless node via a partial `Wiring::build`),
  `remove-node [--cascade]` (refuses attached edges without cascade → `HAS_EDGES`;
  cascade flushes the log, closes+wakes the removed node's endpoint locks, prunes all
  maps, **unregisters a removed writer's origin from the surviving host lock** — audit
  fix), `load --replace` (validates BEFORE teardown so a bad config never destroys a
  good graph). New codes `HAS_EDGES=-32004`, `DEVICE_ABSENT=-32005`. **Deferred**
  (§14, §15.25): `connect`/`disconnect`/`set-attribute` (live-graph surgery; not in
  the Phase 7 Implements line, not validated).
- **Serial-signal verbs (`nodes/serial.rs`/`daemon.rs`/`sys.rs`/CLI, §7.1).**
  `send-break`, `set-modem`, `pulse-dtr` on the retained `Rc<SerialPort>`; `send_break`/
  `pulse_dtr` are **cancel-safe** (a `RestoreGuard` deasserts even if the dispatch
  future is dropped on client disconnect), and `serial_port()` clones the Rc and drops
  the borrow before the awaited sleep (RefCell-never-across-await). `set-modem` is
  ephemeral (does not rewrite config, §15.8). Modem-line readings surface in state via
  a new `sys::read_modem_bits` (TIOCMGET). **No-target doctrine:** a pts genuinely
  lacks modem lines, so `set-modem`/`pulse-dtr` return `ENOTTY` there (the exact
  Tier-3 boundary — the verb reached the live port); `send-break` latches on a pts;
  true master-side DTR/break observation is a Tier-3 hardware checklist item.
- **Doctor P5 + nexus-sim nullmodem (§13/§15.21).** P5 (`probes.rs`) classifies each
  named port dangling/loopback/paired (both directions, so a half-crossed rig is named
  Degraded, never Unsupported) and certifies real UARTs, reporting `skipped (not a
  UART)` for the sim pts. Passive: `--port`-gated like P3. Discovery is a **poll-driven
  continuous scan** with periodic nonce re-sends + a 5 ms yield (a busy-spin on a
  perpetually-ready port would starve a software echo peer — a real bug found while
  hardening). `nexus-sim nullmodem --link-a/--link-b` bridges two PTY pairs as a
  crossed pair. `expectations/linux.jq` gained a P5 `{supported,skipped}` clause.
  **Test note:** `phase7/p5.sh` runs the doctor twice (pair+dangling in one, loopback
  in its own) — a software `pty --echo` peer competing for CPU with other active peers
  in the SAME run is timing-sensitive on a loaded box (a sim/scheduling artifact, not a
  P5 logic issue: a real TX↔RX jumper reflects in hardware). Verified 8/8 under 4×CPU
  load after the split. **Real-hardware follow-up (2026-07-22, commit `8cf61d0`):** the
  paired independent-clock certificate (`p5_certify_pair` — the rate ladder + deliberate
  mismatch) had never run on real UARTs (the sim skips it); its first live run exposed a
  missing post-open baud settle. See the physical-validation block at the top.
- **Validation:** `scripts/validate/phase7/*.sh` (items 1–7) + a reusable
  `scripts/lib/fixture-tree.sh` that builds `/dev/serial/by-id` + `/dev/serial/by-path`
  + sysfs trees under `--dev-root` (the resolver seam, plan §3). `all.sh --through 7`
  = 39/39; 87 workspace unit/property tests.
- **⚠️ Adversarial audit found 5 confirmed (2 high, 1 medium, 2 low), ALL FIXED; do
  NOT regress:** (1) **[HIGH] duplicated non-empty serials** were captured as an
  ambiguous `usb:` identity (only the absent `-` half of §12 was implemented) →
  `usb_identity_ambiguous` degrades duplicates to by-path (test
  `duplicated_serial_degrades_to_by_path`). (2) **[HIGH] `remove-node --cascade` of a
  lock-HOLDING writer** left its origin registered/holding on the surviving host lock
  → a phantom holder wedged the endpoint forever; now `unregister` + wake/emit on
  release (regression in `signals.sh`). (3) **[MEDIUM] `--state-file` help** advertised
  a `/var/lib` default the code never uses → corrected to describe the socket-adjacent
  default + the reboot-durability caveat. (4) **[LOW] `find_usb`** aborted the whole
  by-id scan on one odd symlink (`file_name()?`) → skip the entry, continue. (5)
  **[LOW] empty `raw:`** input resolved to the dev-root dir → rejected as `Malformed`
  (test in `empty_input_is_malformed`). Two findings were REFUTED on verification (a
  `linux.jq` degraded-clause worry that misread intent; a reader POLLERR busy-spin
  unreachable for these fds).

## 6f. Phase 8 (hardening & release) — COMPLETE

The final phase (§13 macOS pass, packaging, docs, fuzzing, release validation).
Built as five slices, then an adversarial audit fixed 5 confirmed findings. No new
ADR (nothing contradicted the design); the additions are all §13/§Phase-8 plan work.

- **macOS portability (design §13, best-effort).** The workspace now COMPILES and
  degrades gracefully on `*-apple-darwin`, verified without a Mac by cross-checking
  `cargo check --target x86_64-apple-darwin --workspace` (which type-checks cfg
  resolution; it found the two blockers *and* one the up-front research missed). Two
  hard-compile blockers, both `#[cfg(target_os = ...)]`-gated: (1) **`libc::TIOCGICOUNT`**
  (Linux-only ioctl) in `serialnexusd/src/sys.rs` and `nexus-doctor/src/sys.rs` —
  gated with a `#[cfg(not(target_os="linux"))]` `read_icounts`/`read_icounter` stub
  returning `ENOTSUP`, which the callers already map to "omit driver counters, never
  fault" (the same path a pts takes on Linux); (2) **`nix::pty::ptsname_r`** (Linux/
  Android-only reentrant variant) in `pty.rs`, `probes.rs`, and `nexus-sim` — a shared
  `sys::ptsname` wrapper (the daemon's + doctor's `sys` modules, a localized
  `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` fn in the deny-unsafe sim) uses `ptsname_r` on Linux and the
  static-buffer `unsafe ptsname` elsewhere. Plus the high-baud `BaudRate::{B460800,
  B921600}` match arms in `pty.rs` (absent on macOS termios) and `nix::unistd::getgroups`
  in the doctor's group-membership check (unavailable in nix on Apple) — both gated.
  Everything else (TIOCPKT/TIOCEXCL/TIOCMGET/TIOCM_*/EXTPROC/the poll(2) data plane/
  the resolver's `std::fs` backends) is portable; on macOS the by-id/sysfs resolver is
  inert at runtime (`usb:`/`by-path:` identities stay `waiting`; `cu.*` raw paths are
  the §12/§13 interim; the IOKit backend is the deferred §14 home). `expectations/
  macos.jq` is a lenient structural gate; the macOS CI lane BUILDS + runs the portable
  tests (gating) and the doctor report + phase-2 e2e informationally. `docs/macos.md`
  records the deltas as verified/expected/unverified.
- **Docs.** `README.md` (elevator pitch + five-minute quickstart, the author ran it);
  `docs/security.md` (the §9 "serial consoles are root shells" posture verbatim + the
  socket-permissions authz model + loopback/`insecure_bind`/SSH); `docs/codec-authors.md`
  (the byte-exact envelope contract + golden vectors + the exec-codec walkthrough);
  `docs/rpc/` (7 man-style pages over the full §10 verb surface, error codes,
  notifications — the docs auditor caught that the daemon defines a 5th app code
  `-32001` load-on-non-empty beyond the four in the research catalog).
- **Packaging.** `packaging/serialnexusd.service` (a hardened systemd unit —
  `DynamicUser`, `RuntimeDirectory`/`StateDirectory`/`LogsDirectory`, sandboxing with
  the deliberate device-access loosenings, validated by `systemd-analyze verify`),
  `serialnexusd.example.toml` (the §2 reference topology; load-verified), a udev rule,
  and `packaging/README.md`.
- **Fuzzing.** `fuzz/` — a cargo-fuzz crate (EXCLUDED from the workspace via root
  `[workspace] exclude`, needs nightly + libFuzzer) with four targets over the pure
  parsers: `envelope_decode` (`try_decode` + roundtrip), `frame_decoder`
  (`FrameDecoder` stream reassembly), `wire_hello` (`try_decode_hello` + stability),
  `reference_demux` (`ReferenceCodec::demux` resync termination + bounded buffer). The
  harness bodies were compile-verified on stable via a throwaway crate (only the
  libFuzzer glue needs nightly); a nightly CI job builds and runs each briefly.
- **Release validation.** `scripts/validate/phase8/{quickstart,agent-task,soak}.sh`.
  quickstart = the five-minute echo, wall-clocked under budget; agent-task = the full
  operator scenario via `serialnexusctl --json` (inspect → lock + LOCKED negative
  control → send --steal → device-received via the echo→log oracle → rotate + byte-exact
  continuity → unlock), all deterministic with `printf|sha256sum` oracles; soak =
  parameterized (`SOAK_SECONDS`, default 8 smoke / nightly 1800+) asserting bounded
  VmRSS, an allowlist of loss counters staying zero, zero faults, and a final
  source↔log checksum reconciliation. CI: the deterministic phase-8 gates run per-push
  (the full `--through 8` sweep is not, to keep per-push CI lean — the heavy phase-3
  firehose/benchmark and multi-daemon topologies stay in the local suite), plus the
  macOS lane and nightly soak/fuzz jobs (`schedule` cron). *(The `phase5/demux.sh`
  flake that once justified capping the sweep is now fixed — see §7.)*
- **⚠️ Audit fixes (5 confirmed, ALL FIXED; do NOT regress).** (1) **[HIGH] packaged
  log node faulted out-of-the-box** — the unit granted `/var/log/serialnexusd` via
  `ReadWritePaths`, which flips the mount but does NOT chown, so the `DynamicUser`
  couldn't create files and the example config's `cap` log node faulted on `EACCES`
  every boot. **Fixed** with `LogsDirectory=serialnexusd` (systemd creates AND chowns
  it); removed the README's manual `install -d` step and documented the chown caveat
  for extra log dirs. (2) **[HIGH] `envelope_decode` fuzz target false-fired** — it
  asserted decode→encode byte-identity, but `try_decode` consumes `frame_end`
  (including trailing body bytes) for Open/Close while `encode` re-emits them empty, so
  a valid Open/Close frame with trailing bytes would report as a fuzz crash. **Fixed**
  by gating byte-identity to Data/Error and relying on decode→encode→decode STABILITY
  for Open/Close (the `wire_hello` pattern). (3) **[HIGH] `soak.sh` loss-counter check
  was a tautology** — `add // 0 == 0` parses as `add // (0==0)` = `add // true` (jq
  `//` binds looser than `==`), so a nonzero drop counter output a truthy number and
  the soak PASSED regardless. **Fixed** with `(add // 0) == 0`; verified it now fails
  on a 4096-byte drop and passes on zero/absent. (4) **[MEDIUM] `RuntimeDirectoryMode`
  shipped 0755** (world-traversable), undermining the design's 0700-parent
  post-bind-window guard (the daemon's own `main.rs` comment relies on it). **Fixed** to
  0700 (and `StateDirectoryMode` 0750→0700, added `PrivateTmp=yes`), aligning the unit
  UP to `security.md`'s tighter claims. (5) **[LOW] `security.md`↔unit drift** (device
  policy wording, a divergent inline unit copy missing the pty device rules). **Fixed**
  by rewording the device-policy prose and replacing the drift-prone inline unit with a
  pointer to the canonical `packaging/serialnexusd.service`. 0 findings refuted. All
  gates green after fixes: 42/42 `all.sh --through 8`, 87 tests, fmt/clippy/macOS-check
  clean.

---

## 7. Environment & operational notes

- **Unix socket path length:** paths are bounded by `SUN_LEN` (~108 bytes). The
  daemon errors clearly on overflow. Real deployments use `/run` or
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`; **test harnesses must use a short dir** (`mktemp -d
  /tmp/snx.XXXXXX`), not the long scratchpad path.
- **Serial device access:** the daemon runs as its own user and needs r/w on the
  device node. On the dev box `/dev/ttyUSB0` was `root:dialout 660`; a udev rule
  `SUBSYSTEM=="tty", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", GROUP="plugdev",
  MODE="0660"` (or dialout membership) grants it. `nexus-doctor`'s env checks
  report `group:*` membership and `access:<dev>`.
- **`Cargo.lock` is committed** (v3 plan §2): this is a binary workspace, and the
  cargo-deny gate is only as strong as the graph it inspects — an uncommitted lock
  would gate a freshly resolved, potentially different graph on every CI run. It was
  removed from `.gitignore` in the v3 realignment.
- **Licensing gate** (`deny.toml`) is proven in CI (rejects `serialport`); keep
  all new deps permissive (MIT/Apache/BSD/ISC/Zlib/Unicode), §13.
- **`nexus-doctor` never gates the daemon:** runtime degradation paths (e.g.
  §7.2's poll) are unconditional, so a wrong probe misleads a developer but never
  the data plane. Keep it that way.
- **`phase5/demux.sh` presence-vs-readiness flake — FIXED (test-fidelity only; no
  daemon change).** The former ~1-in-5-under-load flake was a race in the *test*: the
  mux burst was released once every channel client reported `client_present==true`,
  but a slave can be open (present) a beat before its read loop is draining, so under
  load the burst outran the not-yet-reading consumer and the lossy presence-gated PTY
  shed the head, failing the byte-exact manifest check. The fix is entirely in the
  test double and the harness (plan §3's "presence is not readiness"):
  - **First-byte handshake (the prescribed fix).** `nexus-sim mux` gained
    `--prime-file`/`--prime-bytes` and `client` gained `--skip`/`--ready-file`. Two
    phases: once the clients are present, the mux sends a small primer per channel
    (small enough that a present-but-not-yet-draining PTY buffers rather than drops
    it, so it reliably arrives); each client discards the primer and creates its
    ready-file *on the first byte it reads back* — proof it is draining, not merely
    present; only then does the harness release the payload burst, which can no longer
    outrun a parked reader.
  - **Isolate correctness from drop policy.** The channel PTYs set `hostward_buffer =
    512` so the whole burst is held (this test checks demux *correctness*, not the
    §5 drop policy — that is `exact-loss.sh`/`counters.sh`), and the client read
    buffer grew to 64 KiB so a fast, well-buffered stream drains in few syscalls.
  - **Right-sized for CPU starvation.** The burst dropped to 256 KiB/channel (256
    round-robin frames — full demux coverage) with a 90 s ceiling, so the
    single-threaded daemon completes it comfortably even when heavily CPU-starved,
    rather than the test being hostage to scheduling. Verified: **0 failures in 35
    runs under a fully CPU-saturated box (8 `yes` hogs on 8 cores) and under the
    fair ~4×CPU-load bar** — where the pre-fix test failed ~20-40%.
